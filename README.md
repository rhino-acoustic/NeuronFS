# NeuronFS
### *axiom > algorithm*
### Folder **is** a neuron. Everything else derives.

> AI disobeyed "don't use console.log" 9 times.
> On the 10th, `mkdir 禁console_log` was born.
> On the 11th, AI asked: *"What is vorq?"*
> **It never disobeyed again.**

**Quick Navigation:** [Problem](#the-problem-nobody-talks-about) · [30s Proof](#30-second-proof) · [5 Features](#5-killer-features) · [Comparison](#the-comparison) · [Getting Started](#getting-started) · [Benchmarks](#-deep-dive-benchmarks-41-industry-items) · [Limitations](#limitations-honestly)

## The Problem Nobody Talks About

**2026 reality: quota limits force every developer to mix multiple AIs.**

```
Morning: Claude (Opus quota burnt) → Afternoon: switch to Gemini → Evening: switch to GPT
Claude's learned "禁console.log" rule → Gemini doesn't know → violation again → pain
```

`.cursorrules` is Cursor-only. `CLAUDE.md` is Claude-only. **Switch AI = rules evaporate.**

And the deeper problem — even within ONE session:

```
You: "Please read the codemap before editing code."
AI:  "Sure!" (skips it, starts coding immediately)
```

Text instructions are followed **~60% of the time**. That's not governance. That's hope.

## 30-Second Proof

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhino-acoustic/NeuronFS.git && cd NeuronFS/runtime && go build -o neuronfs . && ./neuronfs --emit all
```

**Result:**
```
[EMIT] ✅ Agents (Universal) → AGENTS.md
[EMIT] ✅ Cursor → .cursorrules
[EMIT] ✅ Claude → CLAUDE.md
[EMIT] ✅ Gemini → ~/.gemini/GEMINI.md
[EMIT] ✅ Copilot → .github/copilot-instructions.md
✅ 5 targets written. One brain. Every AI. Zero runtime dependencies.

## We Attacked Ourselves — 10 Rounds

Before you trust us, watch us try to destroy ourselves.

| # | 🔴 Attack | 🔵 Defense | Verdict |
|---|-----------|------------|---------|
| 1 | **vorq is n=1 validated.** 1 test ≠ proof. | The principle is model-agnostic: unknown tokens force lookup in ALL transformer architectures. | ⚠️ More testing needed |
| 2 | **vorq gets learned** once NeuronFS is popular. | Replace `vorq→bront` in 1 line, `--emit all`. Cost: 0. Time: 10s. Neologisms are disposable by design. | ✅ Defended |
| 3 | **Some AIs don't read _rules.md.** | Target is coding agents (Cursor/Claude Code/Gemini/Copilot). All auto-load project rule files. | ✅ Defended |
| 4 | **P0 brainstem is still just text.** | Yes — intrinsic limit of prompt-based governance. NeuronFS places P0 at prompt top (constraint positioning). Best within limits. | ⚠️ Acknowledged |
| 5 | **"mkdir beats vector" is overstated.** | Intentional L1/L2 separation. NeuronFS = deterministic rules (L1). RAG = semantic search (L2). Complementary, not competing. | ✅ Defended |
| 6 | **Comparison table is biased.** | Partially. UX convenience rows (inline editing, natural language rule adding) should be added. Core structural gaps are factual. | ⚠️ Acknowledged |
| 7 | **Bus factor = 1.** | Open source + zero dependencies = builds forever. `go build` works in 2046. | ⚠️ Real risk |
| 8 | **`source:` freshness is manual.** | MVP. `--grow` auto-detection is on the roadmap. Current workaround: zelk protocol. | ✅ Defended |
| 9 | **AGPL kills enterprise adoption.** | Deliberate. Core value is local execution. AGPL only blocks "take code, build SaaS." Local use = zero restrictions. | ✅ Defended |
| 10 | **`--evolve` depends on AI — contradicts your thesis.** | `dry_run` is default. User approval required. Core thesis is "AI can't break rules," not "AI isn't used." Evolution is assistance, not dependency. | ✅ Defended |

**Score: 7 defended · 3 acknowledged · 0 fatal.**

## 5 Killer Features

### 1. The Axiom — `Folder = Neuron`

One design decision generates the entire system:

```
Axiom: "A folder IS a neuron."
  → File path IS a natural language rule
  → Filename IS activation count (5.neuron = fired 5×)
  → Folder prefix IS governance type (禁=NEVER, 必=ALWAYS, 推=WHEN)
  → Depth IS specificity
  → OS metadata IS the embedding
  → mkdir IS learning
  → rm IS forgetting
```

Without this axiom, there's no reason to combine Merkle chains, RBAC, cosine similarity, and circuit breakers on folders. **The axiom is what makes NeuronFS NeuronFS — not the algorithms.**

### 2. vorq — Neologism Harness (~95%+ behavioral compliance)

We discovered that fabricated words force AI to look up definitions — achieving behavioral compliance that natural language cannot.

| Attempt | Method | Compliance | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Read the codemap" (natural language) | ~60% | AI "knows" this phrase → skips |
| 2 | "Mount cartridge" (proper noun) | ~65% | Meaning guessable → skips |
| 3 | "装カートリッジ 必装着" (kanji) | ~70% | AI infers 装=mount → skips |
| **4** | **"vorq cartridge 必vorq"** | **~95%+** | No training data → must investigate (n=1 observed) |

**vorq** is ASCII-safe, pronounceable, looks like a real command — but exists in no dictionary. AI perceives it as *"new knowledge to learn"* rather than *"known instruction to follow."*

Four neologism runewords: `vorq` (mount cartridge) · `zelk` (sync cartridge) · `mirp` (freshness check) · `qorz` (community search before any tech decision)

### 3. 7-Layer Subsumption Cascade (P0 → P6)

Seven brain regions. Lower priority **always** overrides higher. Physically.

```
brainstem(P0) > limbic(P1) > hippocampus(P2) > sensors(P3) > cortex(P4) > ego(P5) > prefrontal(P6)
     ↑ absolute laws    ↑ emotions    ↑ memory    ↑ environment  ↑ knowledge  ↑ persona  ↑ goals
```

**P0's `禁` rules always beat P4's dev rules.** When `bomb.neuron` fires, the entire region's prompt rendering stops. Not "please don't" — **physically silenced.**

### 4. 3-Tier Governance (ALWAYS / WHEN → THEN / NEVER)

**Who:** Coding agents — Cursor, Claude Code, Gemini Code Assist, GitHub Copilot. Any AI that reads a system prompt.

**Why:** Flat rule lists fail at scale. 300+ rules in one prompt → AI ignores most. Rules need *priority* and *conditionality* — "always do X" is different from "do X only when coding."

**How:** Folder prefixes auto-classify into three enforcement tiers at `emit` time:

```
禁hardcoding       → 🔴 NEVER   (absolute prohibition, immune to decay/prune/dedup)
必go_vet실행        → 🟢 ALWAYS  (mandatory on every response)
推community_search → 🟡 WHEN coding/tech decision → THEN search community first
```

`formatTieredRules()` scans the brain, reads the prefix of each neuron folder, and auto-generates structured `### 🔴 NEVER` / `### 🟢 ALWAYS` / `### 🟡 WHEN → THEN` sections in the system prompt. No manual tagging. `applyOOMProtection()` auto-truncates when total tokens exceed the LLM context window — NEVER rules are preserved first, WHEN rules are trimmed first.

### 5. One Brain, Every AI

```bash
neuronfs --emit all
→ .cursorrules + CLAUDE.md + GEMINI.md + copilot-instructions.md + AGENTS.md
```

`AGENTS.md` is the [2026 universal standard](https://agents.md) — and NeuronFS **compiles** it, not just writes it. Switch AI tools freely. Your rules never evaporate. One brain governs all.

| 3 | **Multi-AI support** | ❌ Cursor-only | API-dependent | ✅ | **✅ `--emit all` → every IDE** |
| 4 | **Priority system** | ❌ Flat text | ❌ | ❌ | **✅ 7-layer Subsumption (P0→P6)** |
| 5 | **Self-evolution** | Manual edit | Black box | Black box | **🧬 Autonomous (Groq LLM)** |

| 13 | **Industry benchmark coverage** | 0/41 | ~8/41 | ~6/41 | **35/41 (85%)** |

> † **Rule accuracy** measures different layers: Mem0/RAG ~95% = "LLM follows retrieved rules" (IFEval). NeuronFS 100% = "rules are faithfully generated into system prompt" (BM-1 fidelity). Complementary, not competing.
>
> ‡ **Behavioral compliance** ~95%+ is based on developer observation (n=1). Principle is model-agnostic (unknown tokens force lookup in all transformers), but independent validation with n≥10 is pending.
>
> **Fair note on Mem0/Letta:** These tools excel at conversation memory and user profiling (their design goal). NeuronFS does not compete on memory CRUD — it governs rules. The ❌ marks indicate "no equivalent feature," not "inferior product."
>
> **$0 infrastructure** assumes Go is installed for building. Pre-built binaries eliminate even this requirement.

## Getting Started

**One-Liner (Linux/macOS/PowerShell 7+):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhino-acoustic/NeuronFS.git && cd NeuronFS/runtime && go build -o neuronfs . && ./neuronfs --emit all
```

**Windows PowerShell 5.1:**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/rhino-acoustic/NeuronFS.git; cd NeuronFS/runtime; go build -o neuronfs.exe .; .\neuronfs.exe --emit all
```

**Step by Step:**
```bash
# 1. Clone & build
git clone https://github.com/rhino-acoustic/NeuronFS.git
cd NeuronFS/runtime
go build -o neuronfs .          # → single binary, zero runtime dependencies

# 2. Create a rule — just a CLI command
./neuronfs --grow cortex/react/禁console_log  # "禁" = absolute prohibition

# 3. Compile brain → system prompts for ANY AI tool
./neuronfs --emit all            # → .cursorrules + CLAUDE.md + GEMINI.md + all formats
```

**Advanced Commands:**
```bash
neuronfs <brain> --emit <target>   # Prompt compilation (gemini/cursor/claude/all/auto)
neuronfs <brain> --grow <path>     # Create neuron
neuronfs <brain> --fire <path>     # Reinforce weight (+1)
neuronfs <brain> --evolve          # AI-powered autonomous evolution (dry run)
neuronfs <brain> --evolve --apply  # Execute evolution
neuronfs <brain> --api             # 3D Dashboard (localhost:9090)
neuronfs <brain> --diag            # Full brain tree visualization
```

> ⚠️ **Auto-Backup:** `--emit` automatically backs up existing rule files to `<brain>/.neuronfs_backup/` with timestamps before overwriting.

> 💡 **`--emit auto`** scans your project for existing editor configs and only generates files for editors you already use. If nothing is detected, falls back to `all`.

### 🎲 "Don't trust us? Destroy it yourself." (Chaos Engineering)
```bash
cd cmd/chaos_monkey
go run main.go --dir ../../my_brain --mode random --duration 10
# Randomly deletes folders and throws spam for 10 seconds.
# Result: FileNotFound panics = 0%. Spam pruned. Brain self-heals.
```

<summary><h2>🎮 Deep Dive: 16 Runewords (Opcodes)</h2></summary>

If you played Diablo 2 — **NeuronFS opcodes work exactly like Runewords.**

A Runeword is a specific combination of runes socketed into the right item base. The magic isn't in any single rune — it's in the **exact combination + exact socket type**.

| Opcode | Rune | Effect | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `禁/` | Zod | **Absolute prohibition** — AI physically cannot cross | `禁/hardcoding/` |
| `必/` | Ber | **Mandatory gate** — AI must pass through | `必/manager_approval/` |
| `推/` | Ist | **Recommendation** — soft nudge, overridable | `推/test_code/` |
| `.axon` | Jah | **Teleport** — connects two distant brain regions | `推/insurance.axon => [claims/]` |
| `bomb` | El Rune | **Kill switch** — entire region freezes | `bomb.neuron` |
| `vorq` | ★ | **Cartridge mount** — AI must read `.neuron` before coding | `vorq=view_file` |
| `zelk` | ★ | **Cartridge sync** — AI must update `.neuron` after coding | `zelk=write .neuron` |
| `mirp` | ★ | **Freshness check** — flags stale cartridges in `_rules.md` | `mirp=mtime compare` |
| `qorz` | ★ | **Community search** — must search Reddit/GitHub/HN before any tech decision | `qorz=search_web` |

> *"The folder is the socket. The opcode is the rune. The combination is the Runeword."*
>
> ★ **vorq/zelk/mirp/qorz** are fabricated neologisms — words that exist in no language or training data. AI cannot guess their meaning and is forced to look up the definition within the neuron system. This achieves ~95%+ behavioral compliance (n=1 observed) where natural language instructions achieve only ~60%.

### 12 Kanji Micro-Opcodes (SSOT)

`禁` (1 char) = `NEVER_DO` (8 chars). Folder names compress 3–5× more semantic meaning per token:

| Kanji | Korean | English | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|
| 禁 | 절대 금지 | Prohibition | `禁/fallback` |
| 必 | 반드시 | Mandatory | `必/KI_auto_reference` |
| 推 | 추천 | Recommendation | `推/robocopy_large` |
| 要 | 요구 | Requirement | Data/format demands |
| 答 | 답변 | Answer | Tone/structure forcing |
| 想 | 창의 | Creative | Limit release, ideas |
| 索 | 검색 | Search | External reference priority |
| 改 | 개선 | Improve | Refactoring/optimization |
| 略 | 생략 | Omit | No elaboration, result only |
| 參 | 참조 | Reference | Cross-neuron/doc links |
| 結 | 결론 | Conclusion | Summary/conclusion only |
| 警 | 경고 | Warning | Danger alerts |

### Nested Opcodes — Prohibition + Resolution in One

```
brainstem/禁/no_shift/必/stack_solution/
         ↑ prohibition  ↑ resolution
```

Read as: *"Prohibit shift (禁), but mandate stacking as the solution (必)."*

<summary><h2>💓 Deep Dive: Limbic Engine (EmotionPrompt)</h2></summary>

The limbic region (P1) implements a **scientifically-backed emotion state machine** that dynamically adjusts AI agent behavior. Based on:

- **Anthropic** ["On the Biology of a LLM"](https://transformer-circuits.pub) (2025): Discovered measurable "functional emotions" inside Claude 3.5.
- **Microsoft/CAS** [EmotionPrompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11760) (2023): Adding emotional stimuli improves LLM performance by **8–115%**.

### 5 Emotions × 3 Intensity Tiers

| Emotion | Low (≤0.4) | Mid (0.4–0.7) | High (≥0.7) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔥 **anger** | +1 verification pass | 3× verification, accuracy > speed | All changes require diff + user approval |
| ⚡ **urgent** | Reduce explanations | Execute core only | One-line answers, no questions, execute now |
| ◎ **focus** | Limit unrelated suggestions | Single-file only | Current function only, don't open other files |
| ◆ **anxiety** | Recommend backup | Prepare rollback, add verification | git stash first, all changes revertable |
| ● **satisfied** | Maintain current patterns | Record success patterns, dopamine | Promote to neuron, allow free exploration |

### Auto-Detection

```
User says "왜 안돼?!" 3+ times → auto-switch to urgent(0.5)
User says "좋아", "완벽" 3+ times → auto-switch to satisfied(0.6)
```

Emotions naturally decay over time via `decay_rate`. Below 0.1 → auto-reset to `neutral`.

<summary><h2>🏗️ Deep Dive: Harness Engineering</h2></summary>

```
2023: Prompt Engineering   — "Write better prompts"
2024: Context Engineering  — "Provide better context"
2025: Harness Engineering  — "Design a skeleton where AI CANNOT fail"
```

NeuronFS is **the working implementation of Harness Engineering** — not asking AI to follow rules, but making it structurally impossible to break them.

### Proof of Pain

**WITHOUT NeuronFS:**
```
Day 1:  AI violates "don't use console.log" → manual correction
Day 2:  Quota exhausted, switch to another AI → same violation repeats
Day 10: You lose your mind.
```

**WITH NeuronFS:**
```
Day 1:  mkdir brain/cortex/禁console_log → violation permanently blocked
Day 2:  Switch AI → --emit all → same brain, same rules
Day 10: Zero violations. Structure remembers what every AI forgets.
```

### Autonomous Harness Cycle

Every 25 interactions, the harness engine automatically:

1. Analyzes **failure patterns** in correction logs
2. Uses Groq LLM to **auto-generate 禁(prohibition)/推(recommendation) neurons**
3. Creates **`.axon` cross-links** between related regions
4. That mistake becomes **structurally impossible to repeat**

### Attention Residuals (Cross-Region Intelligence)

Inspired by [Kimi's Attention Residuals paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.15031):
- TOP neurons generate **query keywords**
- Match against **key paths** in connected regions
- Top 3 related neurons auto-surface in `_rules.md`
- Governance neurons (禁/推) get unconditional boost

### Neologism Harness (vorq/zelk/mirp)

Natural language → ~60% compliance. Kanji → ~70%. **Fabricated ASCII neologisms → ~95%+ (n=1 observed).**

Because AI encounters `vorq` as unknown vocabulary, it treats it as *new knowledge to learn* rather than *known instruction to follow*. The definition (`vorq=view_file`) is placed adjacent, enabling instant action mapping.

Embedded into `_rules.md` via `collectCodemapPaths()` at emit time with automatic `source:` mtime freshness validation.

<summary><h2>🧬 Deep Dive: What's Actually Novel</h2></summary>

Not all of NeuronFS is new. Here's an honest breakdown.

### Existing techniques applied (~60%)

| Component | Origin | NeuronFS usage |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Cosine similarity | IR textbook | Dedup merge only (not core search) |
| Levenshtein distance | String algorithms | Dedup merge, 40% weight in hybrid |
| RBAC | Security standard | region→action mapping on folders |
| AES-256-GCM | Crypto standard | Cartridge encryption to RAM only |
| Merkle chain | Blockchain/Git | Neuron tampering detection |
| Subsumption architecture | Brooks (1986 robotics) | 7-layer cognitive cascade |

> **Core search is path-based** — reverse path tokenization + OS metadata (counter, mtime, depth). No vector DB. No cosine at query time.

### Novel systems — no prior art (~40%)

| System | What it does | Why it's new |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Folder=Neuron paradigm** | `mkdir` = neuron creation. File path = natural language rule. | No system uses OS folders as the cognitive unit. |
| **vorq rune system** | 16 runes (12 kanji + 4 neologisms) encode governance meaning. | A constructed micro-language for AI behavioral control. |
| **3-Tier emit pipeline** | Folder prefixes (禁/必/推) → NEVER/ALWAYS/WHEN → auto-injected into system prompts for any AI. | Rules are "installed" into LLMs, not "suggested." |
| **Filename=Counter** | `5.neuron` = 5 activations. No database. | Metadata IS the filename. Zero-query state. |
| **bomb circuit breaker** | 3 failures → P0 halts entire cognitive region. | Cognitive-level circuit breaker with physical prompt silencing. |
| **Hebbian File Score** | `(Activation × 1.5) + Weight` over file counters. | Synapse-weighted retrieval from a filesystem. |
| **emit → multi-IDE** | One brain → `.cursorrules` + `CLAUDE.md` + `GEMINI.md` + `copilot-instructions.md`. | Single governance source controls every AI simultaneously. |
| **OOM Protection** | `applyOOMProtection()` auto-truncates when tokens exceed LLM context window. | No other system prevents its own context overflow. |

> **The novel part IS the paradigm.** "Folder is a neuron" is the axiom. Everything else derives from it. The existing techniques wouldn't combine without this axiom — there's no reason to put Merkle chains on folders unless folders ARE the data.

## Market Position

> **NeuronFS is not AI agent memory. It's L1 governance infrastructure.**

```
L3: AI Agent Memory  (Mem0, Letta, Zep)         — conversation memory, user profiling
L2: IDE Rules        (.cursorrules, CLAUDE.md)   — static rule files, IDE-locked
L1: AI Governance    (NeuronFS) ◀── HERE         — model-agnostic · self-evolving · consistency guaranteed
```

### The WordPress Analogy

WordPress is free. Themes and plugins are paid. Similarly:
- **NeuronFS engine**: Free ($0) — open source
- **Curated Master Brain**: Premium — battle-tested governance packages

`.cursorrules` files can't be sold. **A brain forged through 10,000 corrections can.**

---

## Limitations (Honestly)

| Issue | Reality | Our Answer |
|---|---|---|
| Scale ceiling | 1M folders? OS handles it. Human cognition can't. | L1 cache design — grip the throat, not store the world |
| Ecosystem scale | Solo project | Open source + zero dep = eternal buildability |
| Marketing | Explaining this in 30 seconds is hard | This README is the attempt |
| vorq validation | n=1 so far | Principle is model-agnostic; more testing incoming |
| P0 is still text | Intrinsic limit of prompt governance | Best positioning within limits |

## FAQ

**Q: "It compiles back to text. How is this different from a text file?"**

**A:** Finding one rule in 1,000 lines, adjusting its priority, deleting it — that drives you insane. NeuronFS provides **permission separation (Cascade)** and **access prohibition (bomb.neuron kill switch)**. When one fires, the entire tier's text literally stops rendering.

**Q: "1000+ neurons = token explosion?"**

**A:** Three defenses: ① 3-Tier on-demand rendering ② 30-day idle → dormant (sleep) ③ `--consolidate` merging via LLM.

**Q: "Why can't Big Tech do this?"**

**A:** **Money** — GPUs are their cash cow. **Laziness** — "Just throw a PDF at AI." **Vanity** — "mkdir? Too low-tech." Exactly why nobody did it. Exactly why it works.

**Q: ".cursorrules does the same thing, right?"**

**A:** `.cursorrules` is a 1-dimensional text file. NeuronFS uses **N-dimensional OS metadata** — what, how important, since when, in what context. These dimensions are physically impossible inside a text document.

### Feedback Loop (new in v5.3)

```
corrections/day tracked in growth.log
  → corrections↓ = evolution working (verde)
  → corrections↑ = regression → auto-alert + prioritize neuronize
```
